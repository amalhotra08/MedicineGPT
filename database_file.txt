Apply pressure: If the cut is bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or sterile gauze to control the bleeding. Maintain pressure for a few minutes until the bleeding stops.\n\n3. Apply an antiseptic: Once the bleeding has stopped, apply an over-the-counter antiseptic ointment or solution to the cut to help prevent infection. Follow the instructions on the product packaging for proper application.\n\n4. Cover the wound: Use a sterile adhesive bandage or dressing to cover the cut. This helps protect it from further injury and keeps it clean.\n\n5. Monitor for signs of infection: Keep an eye on the cut for any signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, warmth, or discharge.
